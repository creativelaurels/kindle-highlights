If the second item is fairly different from the first, we tend to see it as being more different than it actually is. So if we lift a light object first and then lift a heavy object, we estimate the second object as being heavier than we would have estimated it if we had lifted it without first lifting the light one. The contrast principle is well established in the field of psychophysics and applies to all sorts of perceptions.

Autonomic listening is inextricably linked with the need for self-compassion. Self-compassion is an emergent property of the ventral vagal system. Survival states automatically activate self-criticism, so when we move out of safety and connection into a state of protection, we lose the capacity for self-compassion. With the ability to recognize a moment of distress and notice the autonomic state, we move into a moment of awareness instead of simply being swept deeper into dysregulation.

The first statement is a recognition that you have entered a state of dysregulation. Find the words that describe your move out of connection into protection. The second statement recognizes the universal experience of dysregulation. What words convey that for you? And the third statement invites a moment, or a micro-moment, of ventral vagal reconnection. How would you say that? Now, with your three phrases, bring to mind a moment of distress, either a moment of beginning to feel the energy of fight and flight or the pull out of connection into collapse. Let some of that survival energy into your system and say your three phrases to yourself. Do your phrases help you begin to find your way back to regulation where you have access to self-compassion? Rewrite your phrases if needed until you find the words that help you connect with self-compassion.

The challenge is to learn to tune in and turn toward your nervous system, bring curiosity and compassion to the experience, and stay out of judgment and self-criticism as you explore where your autonomic nervous system takes you. Some of the phrases I use to tune in and turn toward are as follows: “It’s my biology wanting to send me a message.” “My job is just to listen.” “I can tune in, turn toward, and listen without needing to make meaning.”

This is the foundation of learning to listen. As you tune in and bring awareness to your states, begin to explore some of these questions: Are these familiar places? Have you found a state that you don’t visit very often? Do you see a pattern that you know well or is there an interesting new pattern emerging? Remember, this is an information-gathering experience, not a meaning-making one. Take time to reflect and document what you’re learning in your journal.

You can use the following questions to begin to listen from the outside in: Where am I? (Locate yourself in time and space.) What’s happening in the environment? Who is around? What am I doing? What state has been activated? Notice that the questions are designed to evoke curiosity, identify concrete external experiences, and lead you to identifying your autonomic state. Use these five questions to practice listening from the outside in.

Listening from the inside out is an equally important way to connect. And just like with listening from the outside in, the goal as you explore this way of listening is to stay in curiosity and out of meaning making. What am I sensing in my body? Where is energy moving? Where is energy not moving? Do I feel filled? Do I feel empty? What state is active in this moment? Similar to the first list, these questions are also designed to evoke curiosity, this time by bringing attention to internal experiences to support connection with your autonomic state.

The brain takes the information that it receives from the body and turns it into a story to make sense of what’s happening in the body.

Then we become more than simple story listeners. We become story editors and story writers.

situation you need to address. Start by identifying an experience you want to explore. Now gather the information you need to move forward. Turn toward the experience and listen to the cues of danger. Take time to really hear what your nervous system wants you to know. Having listened, how do you connect what you learned with what you need to do in a way that brings safety? If you’re working with a resource, experiment with steps you can take to reduce the cues of danger and reconnect with the regulating influence of the practice. If you’re exploring a difficult situation, noticing and naming cues of danger begins to soften them a bit, making it possible to make a plan to work with them. Look for cues of safety that might already be present or cues that you could bring in. Discover what needs to happen so you can honor your survival response and work with your nervous system to take the next steps.

that Ms. Perfectionist’s constant striving for the impossible does not make me any better of a person. Instead, it just tears me down. In the same way that I separated from Ed, I have learned how to break away from Ms. Perfectionist.

Ed’s value system also allows me to be irritable and rude to anyone who gets in his way. When I am under Ed’s influence, I say things that I normally would not say. Once I screamed at Susan, my dietitian, “I hate you!” She was getting in the way of Ed’s plan for my life, so he encouraged me to yell and say something that I really didn’t mean. My value system would not have me yelling at my dietitian, because I was taught to treat others with dignity and respect.

Do you think Ed left me alone at this point? No way. He decided to reach me by phone. So rather than answering my calls immediately, I began paying more attention. When Ed gave me a ring, instead of the screen displaying “Ed,” he somehow disguised himself as “D. Pression,” “I. M. Pain,” or “Ms. Ery.” But I always knew it was Ed and would not pick up the phone.

Whether a binge for you is the size of a “normal” meal or the size of ten meals combined, you might find it helpful to write down what you have eaten and share it with someone on your support team. The unconditional love and acceptance that you will feel far outweighs any initial embarrassment about the binge itself. And if you think you are the best bulimic around, remember, that honor belongs to Jenni.

Ed focuses your attention on all the various aspects of your body that make you feel uncomfortable. “Feel the waistline of your pants,” is one of his favorites. He makes you believe that you are larger than you really are. He makes you feel it, and he makes you see it when you look in the mirror— just like the master hypnotist that he is.

All thoughts vibrate eternally in the cosmos. By deep concentration, a master is able to detect the thoughts of any mind, living or dead. Thoughts are universally and not individually rooted; a truth cannot be created, but only perceived. The erroneous thoughts of man result from imperfections in his discernment. The goal of yoga science is to calm the mind, that without distortion it may mirror the divine vision in the universe.

Reflect that some day you will suddenly have to leave everything in this world-so make the acquaintanceship of God now," the great guru told his disciples. "Prepare yourself for the coming astral journey of death by daily riding in the balloon of God-perception. Through delusion you are perceiving yourself as a bundle of flesh and bones, which at best is a nest of troubles. 35-12 Meditate unceasingly, that you may quickly behold yourself as the Infinite Essence, free from every form of misery.

Your relationship with her is not only at the core of her life, but is also the main determinant of her mood. If your woman has rejected her own feminine core, then she will struggle against her inherent heart-connection with you. She will try to identify with her masculine side, attempting to de-prioritize you and your relationship. She will think that she must “live her own life” and put more energy into her own career, for instance. While it is obviously healthy for every man and woman to learn to become whole and independent, it is self-destructive for your woman to try to lessen the import of your relationship in her life. If she has a feminine sexual essence, the desire for the flow of love is at her core, no matter how dedicated she is to her career or other activities.

Fear is the feeling of refusal. Fear is the feeling of mistrust. Fear is the heart’s contraction that withdraws openness behind walls of protection. Fear is the act of unlove, the negation of love, the refusal to open and offer love’s openness as your gift. Anything less than a life of total loving is fear.

You are exquisitely sensitive to his deep potential—his genuine gifts and fully offered heart—and you are equally sensitive to his self-deception, the way he lies to himself, the distance he creates between himself and his own heart’s desire, and between himself and your heart’s desire. This distance hurts you.

For one reason or another, you probably became convinced that it is better—stronger—to navigate for yourself, to take yourself somewhere rather than trust to be taken by love. You became suppressed in your desire to be seen and worshipped as love’s light. You came to believe that guiding your life’s direction is more important than trusting the fathomless love-wisdom that flows naturally from your deepest heart’s radiance.

Your fullest form of inspiration is worship. You can actually worship the depth of your man’s consciousness. Even if he is holding back, you can feel the deep part of his heart that you do trust. You can see it deep in his eyes and feel it deep in his heart. His deep consciousness becomes the subject of your devotion, whom you dance for and inspire. You know this fearless presence at his depth, even if he is unable to feel it for himself in the moment.

You can each complain: You want more of his loving presence and he wants more sexual energy from you. You can each compromise: He pretends to be interested in what you have to say and you pretend to enjoy his clumsy gropes and superficial life. Or, you can each devote yourself to enjoying your heart’s deepest desire. Your man can relax open and “die” as the deep consciousness that is the source of this moment, free to give his fullest love to you and all without holding back. And you can relax open and love yourself, your man, and the entire world, so that your heart’s light opens wide as this moment’s livingness. Through this mutual offering, you and your man can inspire and invite the deepest gifts of each other’s heart.

If your eyes are soft with love’s yearning, if your voice is spoken as if in bed, modulated by the tone of love’s pleasure, his newspaper-world will feel paltry.

For instance, if your man is not fully present with you, then your heart will feel hurt. If you don’t allow this hurt to be expressed fully and spontaneously from your open heart—as tears or cries of pain—then this emotional energy becomes frustrated behind your suppression and transforms into anger. Your primary emotion, in this case, is hurt. Your secondary emotion is anger, built by the suppression of your hurt.

The reason that marriage is so painful and yet wonderful is because it is a reflection of the gospel, which is painful and wonderful at once.

One of the prime qualities of a friend is constancy. Friends “love at all times” and especially during “adversity” (Proverbs 17:17). The counterfeit is a “fair-weather friend” who comes over when you are successful but goes away if prosperity, status, or influence wanes (Proverbs 14:20; 19:4,6,7). True friends stick closer than a brother (Proverbs 18:24). They are always there for you. Another of the essential characteristics of friendship is transparency and candor. Real friends encourage and affectionately affirm one another (Proverbs 27:9; cf. 1 Samuel 23:16–18), yet real friends also offer bracing critiques: “Faithful are the wounds of a friend” (Proverbs 27:5–6).

And they might as well tackle this spiritual project right away. Why?

"Many rapturous moments have been spent in gazing, almost absent- mindedly, at the ever-changing canvas of God stretched across the firmament, for His touch alone is able to produce colors that vibrate with the freshness of life. That youth of colors is lost when man tries to imitate with mere pigments, for the Lord resorts to a more simple and effective medium-oils that are neither oils nor pigments, but mere rays of light. He tosses a splash of light here, and it reflects red; He waves the brush again and it blends gradually into orange and gold; then with a piercing thrust He stabs the clouds with a streak of purple that leaves a ringlet or fringe of red oozing out of the wound in the clouds; and so, on and on, He plays, night and morning alike, ever-changing, ever-new, ever-fresh; no patterns, no duplicates, no colors just the same. The beauty of the Indian change in day to night is beyond compare elsewhere; often the sky looks as if God had taken all the colors in His kit and given them one mighty kaleidoscopic toss into the heavens.

Then he should remember that this is holy business. No careless or casual dealings will suffice. Let him come to God in full determination to be heard. Let him insist that God accept his all, that He take things out of his heart and Himself reign there in power. It may be he will need to become specific, to name things and people by their names one by one. If he will become drastic enough he can shorten the time of his travail from years to minutes and enter the good land long before his slower brethren who coddle their feelings and insist upon caution in their dealings with God.

Sexuality and intimacy must come together for a relationship to be deep and fulfilling. Sex is part of God’s design for erotic love in marriage and must be developed as well as platonic love, connectedness, and friendship.

Awakening and owning the dreams that God has placed in our hearts isn’t about getting stuff or attaining something. It’s about embracing who we are and who he has created us to be. In him. He is our dream come true, and the one true love of our life. But we can’t love him with our whole hearts when our hearts are asleep. To love Jesus means to risk coming awake, to risk wanting and desiring.

Dear God, My past attempts at getting healthy have been apart from You, and they’ve never worked. I’ve struggled alone, and it has felt impossible, but what has been impossible for me is possible with You (Luke 18:27). Your Word says that “if I trust in You and acknowledge You in all my ways, You will direct my path” (Proverbs 3:5–6). Father, I’m laying down my old ways and seeking You first in my fitness (Matthew 6:33). Guide me in the Holy Spirit and give me the steps. I’ve gone through things that have hurt me so badly that I have felt like I can’t or don’t deserve to succeed, but Your Word says that “because I love You, You will rescue me” (Psalm 91:14). Father, please save me from the lies the enemy wants me to believe. Your Word says that You will do a new thing (Isaiah 43:18). Help me take each step with You, starting today, so I can be the godly woman you made me to be. In Jesus’s name, amen.

but globally speaking, this means partners can reach and respond to each other’s emotional bids for comfort and connection, and can navigate and resolve conflict with emotional safety. They can give and receive love, and when things get hard, they fight fair. All of this leaves them feeling confident in their connection, and secure in their attachment.

In a secure relationship, each partner shows up as their best self, not as a way to get something in return, but out of love and the desire to connect. They share a rich variety of thoughts and emotions with each other and respond to each other with care and sensitivity. They work to meet the other’s needs for sexual connection and physical affection, even when those needs aren’t the same as their own. Each partner is willing to make appropriate sacrifices for the greater good of the relationship. They support each other’s needs for autonomy and the exploration of separate interests. Each partner takes responsibility for their part in maintaining connection and being easy to love. They work to understand each other and validate each other’s feelings. They have each other’s backs and approach life as a team. They have fun together. Securely attached couples make hard decisions together in a way that might lead to disappointment, but not to resentment. They are each other’s primary support system, but each partner also has support systems outside the relationship.

How secure is your relationship with yourself? Are you able to validate your own feelings, treat yourself with warmth and respect, provide self-comfort? Are you willing to understand yourself through the lens of your attachment history instead of through the lens of shame? Do you beat yourself up and constantly tell yourself you’re not good enough, flawed, unlovable? Or do you give yourself the benefit of the doubt and accept yourself for all of you, even the parts you want to work on? Do you practice soothing your big feelings? If not, you’re at risk of having unrealistic expectations of what a partner can provide, and you won’t be able to give these things to your partner because we simply can’t give to a partner what we can’t first give to ourselves.

Then, when you talk to your partner, don’t underestimate the emotionally regulating and connecting power of nonverbal communication and touch. As you say these phrases, try to make eye contact, turn your body toward your partner, open up your stance, use physical touch, hold their hand, or do anything else that can help you physically connect to them, co-regulate, and send the message “You’re important to me.” Sometimes even moving to the same side of the table helps show you’re on the same side.

Cell Metabolism study published in 2019 looked at the power of a 36-hour fast followed by a 12-hour eating window, a style of fasting often referred to as alternate-day fasting (ADF). This particular study was the largest of its kind. When subjects followed an alternate-day fasting regime for 30 days, it was noted that ketone production continued, even when they ate in 12-hour windows. They also saw a reduction in cholesterol and inflammation with the ADF group.16 The most exciting part of this study was the fat loss that happened around the midsection in the ADF group.

When it comes to hormonal imbalances, you may want to get a urinary hormone test like the DUTCH test to know specifically which hormones are out of balance and how you can best go about mapping your fasts to fix those hormones. For example, if you know your estrogen levels are low you might want to do a longer fast in the first 15 days of your cycle, whereas if progesterone is low you want to make sure you’re not fasting the week before your period.

Flexibility is what makes building a fasting lifestyle so fun. You get to create it however it fits best into what life experiences are before you. This is a huge shortcoming of too many diets. If you are at home with a routine, that diet may be easy to follow. Once that routine changes or you are presented with a social gathering that doesn’t have the food your diet requires, you are stuck with the difficult decision of what to eat. Fasting is freedom.

Lastly, if you have been tested for Epstein-Barr virus and know that you have high amounts, the key fasting principle to know here is that one way to stop viral replication is to have your cells operating from your fat-burning energy pathways the majority of the time. When you’re doing the longer fasts, a diet low in carbohydrates will be best. You will see that I have lots of low-carb living in this protocol.

Forty-eight hours or longer without food is long enough for your digestion to slow down significantly. This means that when you reintroduce food, you want to be strategic about how you do that. The first three-day water fast I went on, I was so excited to eat food that I had a huge plate of scrambled eggs afterward. I immediately felt sleepy. I also felt like I had a huge lump in my stomach, and it took almost 24 hours for that feeling to go away. To avoid this reaction, I came up with four steps to follow when you break a longer fast. These steps will ensure that you are refeeding your microbiome properly and easing back into food.

Lunch-to-lunch can be better for women who have thyroid issues, either diagnosed or undiagnosed. (Many women do not know they have hypothyroidism. So many of us just accept that we are tired all the time, but in fact we have an undiagnosed thyroid issue, often caused by inflammation.) When the thyroid is deficient, it causes the adrenals to work harder, exacerbating cravings and fatigue in the afternoon. By eating lunch and supporting the adrenals, we mitigate those effects.

Individuals who suffer from isolation anxiety in relationships are withdrawn and prefer to be alone. They may be irritable and cranky. They are not inherently bad people; they simply prefer to be alone, and when they are in relationships, they expect (or rather demand) that their partners be helpful and accommodating, despite the fact that this is not how a healthy relationship should operate. People with this type of anxiety don’t know how to make concessions and expect everyone else to bow and adhere to their will, which leads to the relationship becoming nearly dictatorial in nature—which no one wants.

You are to walk every day in the spirit and not the flesh.  The flesh wants you to sin but your spirit wants you to serve the Lord and be blessed with Heavenly gifts from above all of your days instead of having your blessings blocked by sin.  You are more than a conqueror when you are in the spirit.  God loves you so much and wants you to talk with Him every day (and in the evenings He wants to give you prophetic dreams showing you the future that He has for you).  God wants to bless His people but can only do so when we align our will with His; because otherwise it can cause us to move farther away from Him if we sin on a regular basis. That gives the enemy a toe hold and a right to harm us and blocks the blessing from the Lord.

Using the prefrontal cortex, we can begin to observe where we feel wounded in areas of attachment and “reparent” them when we feel rejected, isolated, overly self-reliant, or scared.

Although the sound of the banging door is not necessarily dangerous, your coping strategy tells you that shutting down is the safest way to deal with this possible threat, and you will likely bypass your social engagement system (i.e., ignore the instinct to reach out for help), perhaps only briefly experience the urgency of fight/flight, and then move right into dissociation

No, not truly. Did she in any way need to abide by her family’s norms now that she was an adult? Nope, she truly could do what she thought was best. If her mom distanced herself from their relationship as a result, would Anya be okay? Yes. In fact, Anya wasn’t sure she wanted a close relationship anyway.

For example, when clients are becoming overwhelmed, I guide them through an exercise known as “I Am Aware.”[10] First, I have the clients identify what they are aware of from a sensory standpoint. They typically say something like this: “I am aware of the temperature of the room. I am aware of the texture of the wall. I am aware of the firm ground beneath my feet. I am aware of a slight smell of citrus.” They continue on until they feel connected to the present, which then brings relief from any disturbing emotions or sensations.

We say God loves us, but we’ve internalized the belief that we have to punish our bodies because they don’t reach a certain standard. We ignore, shame, or disregard our humanity. As a result, when we speak of God’s love, we don’t mean that He loves all parts of us; we mean that He loves our spirits. Or we pray as though we value our flesh and bones, but we don’t think the pain we experience in our bodies affects our whole person.

God thinks that you will actually come to know and love him better as a desperate and weak sinner in continual need of grace than you would as a triumphant Christian warrior who wins each and every battle against sin. This makes sense out of our experience as Christians. If the job of the Holy Spirit is to make you more humble and dependent on Christ, more grateful for his sacrifice and more adoring of him as a wonderful Savior, then he might be doing a very, very good job even though you still sin every day.

When God changes the will and gives someone a great desire for obedience but not the strength to withstand temptation, he is putting his child in a painful and difficult position. Yet he does this in love and not with judgment or punishment in mind. He is humbling this child in a powerful way and crushing the child’s self-reliance. This can feel like a curse, when it is actually a great gift.

As my anger toward God poured out of my heart, I was able to see it clearly and confess it to God and others. Then he kindly granted me repentance. Gluttony was the sin that showed me so many other, less visible sins that had nested in my heart quietly for many years, unseen by me. Yet repentance and change did not come together, as we are so often told they must. God gave me grace to grieve over my sin and hate it long before he granted me the grace to grow in that area.

This was the grace a counselor had described to me many years earlier, a grace I couldn’t yet imagine or understand. This was grace to stay very weak and to struggle daily with sin, and yet to dance and frolic in the complete certainty of God’s love for me. This was to be in Christ, joined to him in his death and his obedience, and to delight in the same love the Father has for him. This was grace to have outrageous joy in the presence of painful failure: grace not just to survive great failure, but to thrive in the face of it. This was amazing, extravagant, and inexplicable grace, where personal pride was lovingly shattered so that all I could possibly do was look to Christ, admire his perfection, and marvel at his love for such a profoundly troubled person.

Their confidence to mature is placed squarely in trust of their new identity in Jesus.13 This does not mean they don’t fail. They do fail. But in the end they trust who God has made them.

God never tells me to get over something and just get past it. Never. Instead, He asks me to trust Him with every circumstance.10 This involves communicating with Him honestly, in detail, until I’m sure I’ve left nothing out. He wants to hear it all. He wants to enter into every tear, every detail. He’s been waiting for this moment. He’s watched me go it alone. Now He will sit, elbows on knees, hands on chin, listening to every single word. I must sigh, cry, shriek, or howl, until He’s certain I’m done, that I’ve gotten it all out.

For this purpose God must communicate with you, the one who is to be guided. This is the only means by which God can have an impact on you and yet still leave you with the mental and spiritual space to retain integrity as a free personality. You can live as God’s friend yet also govern your own life.

God communicates through what we recognize as a voice or as words addressed to—or even through—us. The primary manner of communication from God to humankind is the Word of God, or God’s speaking. The Bible itself is God’s speaking preserved in written form.

One of the most important things we can learn is the superiority of the voice—however the “voice” may come, even as the still, small voice within the silence of our own minds—over the other types of encounters. This superiority lies in two things: the clarity of its content and the advanced spiritual condition of those who can hear and receive it.

This all goes to make the following point. Here, in this restricted range of direct action, God has given us a power that, so far as our conscious control is concerned, is as immediately creative as his own. A realization of how our own thoughts (inner words) translate themselves into an act of creation is absolutely vital if we are to gain any concrete sense of God’s rule through his word. Only if we have some understanding of what it means for his word to act will we have any grounds for believing that God can have a personal, guiding relationship with us.

Always ask, What is my life like since this is true, and how shall I speak and act because of this? You may wish to turn the passage into a prayer of praise or request.

The quality of God’s voice is more a matter of the weight or impact an impression makes on our consciousness. A certain steady and calm force with which communications from God impact our soul incline us toward assent and even toward active compliance. Our innermost being seems to say Yes, this is true and right. The assent or compliance is frequently given before the content of the communication is fully grasped. At least I find it so, and others do as well.

Our innermost being seems to say Yes, this is true and right. The assent or compliance is frequently given before the content of the communication is fully grasped. At least I find it so, and others do as well. We also sense inwardly the immediate power of God’s voice. And once we have experienced it, we no longer marvel at how nature and spirits responded to this divine word in scriptural accounts. The unquestionable authority with which Jesus spoke to nature, humans and demons clearly manifested this quality of the word of God.

The voice of the subconscious argues with you, tries to convince you; but the inner voice of God does not argue, does not try to convince you. It just speaks, and it is self-authenticating. It has the feel of the voice of God within it.

It couldn’t have been any clearer if my wife had spoken the words right next to me. It was spoken straight and strong and right into my spirit. It wasn’t a demanding, urgent voice.

Ask God to be pleased to make known to you what is the riches of the glory of this mystery (Colossians 1:27).3

The sincere seeker should assume that this is so and should move forward with faith in God if no specific word comes on the matter concerned after a reasonable period of time. All of this is consistent with there sometimes being only one choice that would perfectly fit God’s will for us. Our choices must be approached on a case-by-case basis, just as life is lived one day at a time, trusting God.
